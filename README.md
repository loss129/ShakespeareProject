# ShakespeareProject
Guessing game for Shakespeare characters

Title of Play we are using:
Midsummer Night's Dream



Description:
This project is a game like 20 quesitons. The computer will choose a random number between 1 and 5 to indicate which character it will pretend to be. The user will enter the number associated with the question that they want to ask the computer. The computer will provide a response based on the character it is pretending to be. The user will be able to ask all 20 questions and be able to guess at any time during the questioning what character they are talking to. The user can only ask the 20 questions, no more. If the user guesses the correct character within the 20 questions then they win. 

The characters the computer will emulate include:
Bottom, Lysander, Hermia, Demetrius, Helena 

Relevance of Shakespeare in Today's World:
This project shows how relevant Shakespeare is in today's world by using a computer as a platform for a project based on Shakespeare. Computers are the most relevant thing in today's world. If Shakespeare can make it into a computer program, then it shows just how relevant Shakespeare is in today's world.
