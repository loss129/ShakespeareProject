Shakespeare Project: Lucas Sward, Brian Caverly
Guessing game for Shakespeare characters

Title of Play we are using:
A Midsummer Night's Dream

Description:
For this project we will create a game, similar to 20, questions in which the user will attempt to guess which character the computer is emulating. The computer will choose a random number between 1 and 5 to determine which character it will pretend to be. The user will then be able to enter the number associated with the question that they want to ask the computer, given a list of 20 potential questions. The computer will provide a response based on the character it is pretending to be. The user will be able to ask all 20 questions and be able to guess at any time during the questioning what character they are talking to. The user can only ask the 20 questions, no more. If the user guesses the correct character within the 20 questions then they win. The 20 questions will not be simple yes or no questions, thus there will be 20 in depth answers per character for a total of 100.

The characters the computer will emulate include: Bottom, Lysander, Hermia, Demetrius, Helena 

Relevance of Shakespeare in Today's World:
This project places Shakespeare in a modern context by using a computer program as the platform for a game based around Shakespeare's work. Computers and programming are incredibly modern inventions therefore displaying Shakespeare's work in a small computer game strongly relates Shakespeare to our contemporary period.

Relevance to the play:
Dreams are a strong theme in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. In the play, real life and fantasy constantly overlap. This project compliments that theme in the play because computers help people escape to a fantasy land and continue to advance in their ability to do so, especially with the growing popularity of virtual reality. By putting elements of A Midsummer Night’s Dream into a computer, we can expand on the theme of dreams and fantasy.
